// Rename the file or directory src to dst. If dst exists, the operation will
// fail with an OSError subclass in a number of cases:
//
// On Windows, if dst exists a FileExistsError is always raised. The operation
// may fail if src and dst are on different filesystems. Use shutil.move() to
// support moves to a different filesystem.
//
// On Unix, if src is a file and dst is a directory or vice-versa, an IsADirectoryError
// or a NotADirectoryError will be raised respectively. If both are directories and dst
// is empty, dst will be silently replaced. If dst is a non-empty directory, an OSError
// is raised. If both are files, dst will be replaced silently if the user has permission.
// The operation may fail on some Unix flavors if src and dst are on different filesystems.
// If successful, the renaming will be an atomic operation (this is a POSIX requirement).
